# Deep Learning based Food Classification and Nutritional value Estimation

This project provides a simple and efficient way of estimating calories from a food image. A CNN which is trained using transfer learning on Inception v3 model using Food 101 dataset with 86.6% training accuracy is used to classify the food. A smartphone-based application is employed for image acquisition. A lightweight ratio transfer algorithm is developed to estimate the size of food with reference to the calibration object and compute the total calories present in the food image.
